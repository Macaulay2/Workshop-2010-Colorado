Add your package source files to this directory.  If your package is to have
multiple files, make a subdirectory whose name is the same as the name of the
package, and add

	 AuxiliaryFiles => true

as an argument to newPackage.

Your files here can be seen by the world, so don't put anything confidential
here.
