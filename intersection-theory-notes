1 No need to to saturate the kernel of a map to a domain (sec 4.1)
perhaps mention the realization of the Pluecker ideal for the 
G(1, n) as 4x4 pfaffians of a generic nxn skew matrix

4.2: maybe avoid d' and use e or some such instead?

How about code for circles tangent to 3 given circles (circle = conic through two given points, thought of
as the "circular points" 1, i and 1, -1 on the line at infty.) 


Name Chow rings (esp 4.43): A37 = A^*(G(3,7) for example.

4.43: "zero locus of.." = nonsingular quadric

4.44: needs text to explain
