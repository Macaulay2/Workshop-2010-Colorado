    GraphicalModels
  Headline
    A package for discrete and Gaussian statistical graphical models 
  Description
    Text
      This package extends Markov.m2. It is used to construct ideals corresponding to discrete graphical models,
      as described in several places, including the paper: Luis David Garcia, Michael Stillman and Bernd Sturmfels,
      "The algebraic geometry of Bayesian networks", J. Symbolic Comput., 39(3-4):331â€“355, 2005.
  
      The package also constructs ideals of Gaussian Bayesian networks and Gaussian graphical models 
      (graphs containing both directed and bidirected edges), as described in the papers:
      Seth Sullivant, "Algebraic geometry of Gaussian Bayesian networks", Adv. in Appl. Math. 40 (2008), no. 4, 482--513;
      Seth Sullivant, Kelli Talaska and Jan Draisma, "Trek separation for Gaussian graphical models", 
      Annals of Statistics 38 no.3 (2010) 1665--1685. 
      
      Further, the package contains procedures to solve the identifiability problem for 
      Gaussian graphical models as described in the paper: 
      Luis D. Garcia-Puente, Sarah Spielvogel and Seth Sullivant, "Identifying causal effects with computer algebra", 
      Proceedings of the $26^{th}$ Conference of Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence.
      
      Here is a typical use of this package.  We create the ideal in 16 variables whose zero set 
      represents the probability distributions on four binary random variables which satisfy the
      conditional independence statements coming from the "diamond" graph d --> c,b --> a.
    Example
       G = digraph  {{a,{}},{b,{a}},{c,{a}},{d,{b,c}}}
       R = markovRing (2,2,2,2)
       S = globalMarkov G 
       I = markovIdeal(R,G,S)
       netList pack(2,I_*)
    Text
      Sometimes an ideal can be simplified by changing variables.  Very often, 
      by using @TO marginMap@
      such ideals can be transformed to binomial ideals.  This is the case here.
    Example
       F = marginMap(1,R)
       I = F I
       netList pack(2,I_*)
    Text
      This ideal has 5 primary components.  The first component is the one that has statistical significance.
      It is the defining ideal of the variety parameterized by the 
      the factorization of the probability distributions 
      according to the graph G. The remaining components lie on the boundary of the simplex
      and are still poorly understood.
    Example  
      netList primaryDecomposition I 
    Text
      The following example illustrates the caveat below.
    Example
       H = digraph {{d,{b,a}},{c,{}},{b,{c}},{a,{c}}}
       T = globalMarkov H  
       J = markovIdeal(R,H,T);
       netList pack(2,J_*)
       F = marginMap(3,R);
       J = F J;
       netList pack(2,J_*)
    Text
      Note that the graph $H$ is isomorphic to $G$, we have just relabeled the vertices. 
      Observe that the vertices of $H$ are stored
      in lexicographic order. Also note that the this graph isomorphism lifts to an isomorphism of ideals.     
  Caveat
     This package requires Graphs.m2, as a consequence it can do computations with graphs
     whose vertices are not necessarily labeled by integers. This could potentially create some confusion about what does
     $p_{i_1i_2\cdots i_n}$ mean. The package orders the vertices lexicographically, so 
     $p_{i_1i_2\cdots i_n} = p(X_1 = i_1, X_2 = i_2, \dots, X_n = i_n)$ where the labels
     $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$ have been ordered lexicographically. Therefore, the user is encouraged
     to label the vertices in a consistent way (all numbers, or all letters, etc).

    pairwise Markov statements for a directed graph
  Usage
    pairMarkov G
  Inputs
    G:Digraph 
  Outputs
    L:List
      whose entries are triples {A,B,C} representing pairwise Markov  conditional independence statements of the form
      ''A is independent of B given C'' that hold for G.
  Description
    Text
      Given a directed graph G, pairwise Markov statements are statements of the form \{v,w,nondescendents(G,v)-w\} 
      for each vertex v of G. In other words, for every vertex v of G and all non-descendents w of v, 
      v is independent of w given all other non-descendents. 
      
      For example, for the digraph D on $4$ vertices with edges a-->b, a-->c, b-->c, and b-->d, 
      we get the following pairwise Markov statements:
    Example
      D = digraph {{a,{b,c}}, {b,{c,d}}, {c,{}}, {d,{}}}
      L = pairMarkov D

  Description
    Text
      Given a directed graph G, local Markov statements are of the form
      \{$v$, nondescendents($v$) - parents($v$), parents($v$)\} .
      That is, 
      every vertex $v$ of G is independent of its nondescendents (excluding parents) given the parents. 
      
      For example, for the digraph D on 4 vertices with edges a-->b, a-->c, b-->c, and b-->d, 
      we get the following local Markov statements:
    Example
      D = digraph {{a,{b,c}}, {b,{c,d}}, {c,{}}, {d,{}}}

  Consequences
    Item
      Information about this sequence of integers is placed into the ring, and is used 
      by other functions in this package.  Also, at most one ring for each such sequence
      is created: the results are cached.
  Description
    Text 
      The sequence $d$ represents the number of states each discrete random variable can take.
      For example, if there are four random variables with the following state space sizes
    Example
      d=(2,3,4,5)
    Text 
      the corresponding ring will have as variables all the possible joint 
      probability distributions for the four variables:
    Example
      R = markovRing d;
      numgens R
      R_0, R_1, R_119 --here are some of the variables in the ring
    Text
      If no coefficient choice is specified, the polynomial ring is created over the rationals. 
    Example
      coefficientRing R
    Text 
      If we prefer to have a different base field, the following command can be used:
    Example
      Rnew = markovRing (d,Coefficients=>CC); 
      coefficientRing Rnew
    Text
      We might prefer to give diferent names to our variables. The letter ''p'' suggests a joint probability, 
      but it might be useful to create a new ring where the variables have changed. This can easily be done
      with the following option:
    Example
      d=(1,2);
      markovRing (d,VariableName=>q);
      vars oo --here is the list of variables.

     Text
       The ideal corresponding to a conditional independence statement {A,B,C} (where A,B,C,
       are disjoint lists of integers in the range 1..n (n is the number of random variables)
       is the #C+1 x #C+1 minors of the submatrix of the generic symmetric matrix M = (s_{(i,j)}), whose
       rows are in A union C, and whose columns are in B union C.  In general, this ideal need not be prime.
       
       These ideals were first written down by Seth Sullivant, in "Algebraic geometry of Gaussian Bayesian networks". 
       The routines in this package involving Gaussian variables are all based on that paper.
     Example
       R = gaussianRing 5;

   Description 
     Text
       Given a mixed graph G with directed and bidirected edges, let L be the matrix corresponding to 
       the directed edges (see @TO directedEdgesMatrix@) and let W be the matrix corresponding to 
       the bidirected edges (see @TO bidirectedEdgesMatrix@). Then, the covariance matrix S 
       (see @TO covarianceMatrix@) of the random variables in the gaussian graphical model corresponding
       to the mixed graph G can be parametrized by the matrix equation $S = (I-L)^{-T}W(I-L)^{-1}$, where
       I is the identity matrix.
       
       The entry $S_{(i,j)}$ of the covariance matrix can also be written as the sum of all monomials corresponding
       to treks between vertices i and j. See @TO trekSeparation@ for the definition of a trek. The monomial corresponding
       to a trek is the product of all parameters associated to the directed and bidirected edges on the trek.
       
       The following example shows how to compute the ideal of the model using the parametrization.
     Example
       G = mixedGraph(digraph {{b,{c,d}},{c,{d}}},bigraph {{a,d}})
       R = gaussianRing G
       S = covarianceMatrix(R,G)
       L = directedEdgesMatrix(R,G)
       W = bidirectedEdgesMatrix(R,G)       
       M = gaussianParametrization(R,G)
       J = delete(0_R, flatten entries (L|W))
       eliminate(J, ideal(S-M))
     Text
       This next example shows how to use the option @TO SimpleTreks@ to compute a parametrization using simple treks 
       instead of all treks. The resulting covariance matrix has diagonal entries equal to 1.
     Example
       G = mixedGraph(digraph {{b,{c,d}},{c,{d}}},bigraph {{a,d}})
       R = gaussianRing G

      to simple treks between vertices i and j. Here, a simple trek is a trek (P_L,P_R) where the paths P_L and P_R 
      do not have any common vertices except perhaps at their source. See @TO trekSeparation@ for the definition of a trek.
      
      If the option {\tt SimpleTreks => false} is used, then the sum is over 
      all treks, and not just simple treks.

       A trek between vertices i and j in a mixed graph G with directed and bidirected edges is a triple

       of directed edges with sink j and source l, and either k=l or there is a bidirected edge between k and l.
       Let A,B,CA,CB be subsets of vertices of G. 
       
       We say that (CA,CB) trek-separates A from B in G if for every trek 
       (P_L,P_R) from a vertex in A to a vertex in B, either P_L contains a vertex in CA or P_R contains a vertex in CB.
       
       The function @TO trekSeparation@ returns a list of trek separation statements \{A,B,CA,CB\}\,where 
       #CA + #CB < min(#A, #B). Each statement is maximal in the ordering where \{A1,B1,CA,CB\}\,<\,\{A2,B2,CA,CB\}\,if A1 is a 
       subset of A2 and B1 is a subset of B2. Each statement is also unique up to symmetry, since \{B,A,CB,CA\}\,is a
